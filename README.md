### About Me

At heart, I've always been a creative storyteller. As a child, I eagerly anticipated writing hour in class, valuing it as a time to explore my imagination and express myself without social fears. Simultaneously, my love for sports blossomed. At age 8, I became captivated by basketball, drawn to its emphasis on precision and decision-making. I marveled at the practice required for shooting accuracy and was fascinated by the strategic aspects of coaching and team management.

Technology was another childhood passion. Though often denied the latest gadgets, I voraciously researched how devices worked, viewing them as tools to enhance lives. These early interests in storytelling, sports analysis, and technology would later converge in unexpected ways.

Entering college at UC San Diego, I initially chose English as my "safe" major. However, I quickly realized this path didn't encompass all my passions and career goals. Feeling lost, I then discovered Cognitive Science and Data Science – fields that perfectly aligned with my diverse interests. Here, I could explore the cognition behind decision-making, learn about life-changing technologies like machine learning and AI, and apply these tools to projects tailored to my passions. Importantly, I could continue to express my creativity through data visualization and analytical writing.

Now, as a Data Science Master's student at UC Irvine, I'm furthering my skills and embracing unique challenges. I love working from the ground up to solve problems efficiently, combining the creative magic and precise nature I've cultivated since childhood. My analytical mindset aligns well with sectors prioritizing decision-making, risk management, and pattern recognition.

As I progress towards my December 2024 graduation, I reflect on my journey. From the quiet child who loved writing and basketball to the tech enthusiast dreaming of the latest gadgets, each experience has shaped my approach to data science. This unconventional path has given me a unique perspective, blending creativity with analytical rigor and a passion for understanding complex systems.

Looking to the future, I'm excited about the possibilities in data science. I see myself not just as a data scientist, but as an innovator who uses data to tell stories, solve problems, and make impactful decisions. My diverse background equips me with valuable insights for this field, and I'm eager to apply my blend of creativity and analytical thinking to drive innovation in data science.

### Projects
#### Autoencoder Anomaly Analysis for NBA Players:

Inspired by the **Mamba Mentality** of my all-time favorite player, Kobe Bryant, I embarked on a data science journey to analyze his legendary 2008-2009 NBA season. This project wasn't just about numbers; it was about understanding the **heart and soul of a champion** through data. I developed a **custom autoencoder deep learning algorithm** using **PyTorch**, designed to detect statistical anomalies in Kobe's game-by-game performance. The model processed **20 advanced basketball metrics** across 100 games, including both regular season and playoffs. By implementing **Min-Max scaling** and carefully structuring the **neural network architecture** with ReLU and sigmoid activation functions, I created a strong system capable of capturing the nuances of Kobe's play. The autoencoder achieved **100% accuracy in identifying performance outliers**, effectively distinguishing between Kobe's average games and those spectacular moments that defined his career. This project not only showcased my technical skills in **deep learning** and **anomaly detection** but also demonstrated my ability to blend passion with precision – a trait I carry from Kobe's influence into every aspect of my data science work.

#### Advanced NBA Referee Analysis:

Growing up, I was captivated by the fast-paced excitement of NBA games, but I often found myself puzzled by controversial calls that seemed to shift the momentum unfairly. This curiosity about the human element in officiating sparked a data-driven quest to unravel the complexities of referee decision-making. Once again channeling my **passions for basketball and data science**, I embarked this project to analyze NBA referee patterns using **advanced neural networks**. I engineered a data frame with **over 30,000** datapoints that captured the precise statistics of 47 experienced referees across all 30 NBA teams, which included the referees’ total games officiated for each team, win/loss percentages, average points, free throw attempts, personal, offensive, and shooting fouls, and statistics for the opponents that each team faced. This dataset became the foundation for my deep learning exploration, where I implemented **three feed-forward neural networks (FNNs)** and, most innovatively, a **1D convolutional neural network (CNN)**. The CNN's remarkable **92% test accuracy** not only validated my approach but also opened new avenues for enhancing the fairness and integrity of the sport I love. As a whole, I successfully contributed to a future where technology and human judgment work in harmony, ensuring every whistle blown is as fair as the game itself.

#### Predicting CCRB's Outcome on Civilian Complaints

Contributing important insights to the ongoing dialogue about leveraging technology to improve transparency and accountability in law enforcement practices, I collaborated with three classmates on a project addressing police accountability in New York City during my final year at UCSD. We developed a predictive system for civilian complaint outcomes against NYPD officers that achieved a remarkable **97.3% F1-score**. Utilizing a dataset of 279,645 unique complaints from the NYPD Misconduct Complaint Database, our work involved extensive **feature engineering**, transforming raw data into meaningful predictors and addressing the significant challenge of imbalanced classes in our target variable `CCRBDisposition`. We implemented and compared four machine learning models: **logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting**. To gain deeper insights into the factors influencing CCRB decisions, we employed the **Eli5 Python library** for feature importance analysis. This process revealed key predictors such as the officer's status, gender, and allegation type. After complete evaluation using **F1-scores**, **precision**, and **recall** metrics, logistic regression emerged as the optimal algorithm. This project not only enhanced our practical data science skills but also demonstrated the potential of data science in addressing critical societal issues.

#### R Case Study
Investigating the critical public health issue of tobacco usage among American youth, I led a comprehensive analysis of CDC data from 2015-2019. Utilizing R programming tools like **tidyverse, dplyr, and ggplot2**, we uncovered significant trends including the **surge in sweet-flavored vapes** and a **zero-sum relationship** between e-cigarette adoption and traditional tobacco use. Our findings raised important questions about e-cigarette marketing strategies and their impact on young consumers, potentially influencing public health policies addressing youth tobacco use.

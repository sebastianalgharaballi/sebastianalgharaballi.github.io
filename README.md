As a Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist, I blend creativity with analytical rigor and precision to solve complex data-driven problems. My journey from a young storyteller and basketball enthusiast to a tech-savvy innovator has shaped my unique approach to data science. I'm passionate about creating and fine-tuning ML and AI models, leveraging data for decision-making, and applying these tools to projects that align with my diverse interests. Currently honing my skills as a Data Science Master's student at UC Irvine and as a Machine Learning Engineer at MoodMe, I thrive on challenges that allow me to efficiently solve problems from the ground up, always infusing my work with the same creativity and precision that has driven me since childhood.

### Education

I'm currently attending UC Irvine in their Master's of Data Science program. I will be graduating in December 2024. Before UC Irvine, I graduated from UC San Diego with a Bachelor's of Science in Machine Learning and Neural Computation, housed within their Cognitive Science department. While at UC San Diego, I also obtained a certification in Machine Learning Methods from their Extension program.

### Experience
#### Scale AI - Generative Artificial Intelligence Prompt Engineer (May 2024 - Present)
I started working for Scale AI as a freelance Gen AI Prompt Engineer in May 2024. My day-to-day work consists of editing, refining, and training open-source large language model (LLM) responses to enhance accuracy and coherence in real-time conversations. I've also had the opportunity to apply regression modeling to predict user satisfaction scores on a five-star scale from various conversation metrics, such as the overall sentiment of prompts given to the LLM. My favorite impactful moment at Scale was when I worked directly wiht OpenAI to analyze conversational datasets taken from real-world conversations their users had with ChatGPT. I leveraged clustering techniques, such as K-means and Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC), to identify user patterns like query complexity, topic preferences, and interaction frequency. As a whole, the strategies I deployed informed GPT-model adjustments and improved response relevancy, generating new training data that will aid in improving future iterations of ChatGPT.

#### MoodMe - Machine Learning Engineer & Co-Founder (December 2023 - Present)
The highlight of my Data Science career thusfar has been being named a Co-Founder and Machine Learning Engineer for MoodMe, an innovative start-up company that focuses on emotional intelligence products for a wide-range of industries. I led the creation and implementation of machine learning models for unbiased emotion detection applications. More specifically, I love to tell others about my experience with developing a customized text emotion detection model (powered by a tuned version of Hugging Face's BERT) that would go on to be the backbone of our well-being diary application that helps users track and understand their emotional patterns over time. I also conducted a comprehensive benchmark of the company's face emotion, gender, age, and ethnicity detection models versus its competitors, and leveraged my analysis to enhance the in-house emotion model through techniques such as transfer learning and noise injection. This led to an immediate increase in performance across all platforms the model was deployed on!

#### Donald Bren School of ICS - Master of Data Science Ambassador 
October 2023 - Present
Throughout my time at UC Irvine, I worked as a Master of Data Science Ambassador for the MDS program. A perfect way to describe this role is "being a liaison for the current student." 
- Student representative for the MDS Program.
- Supported the creation and development of ideas for marketing campaigns.
- Conducted time series analysis using R's "forecast" library and Python's "statsmodels" to track and predict trends in data science master's programs across the U.S., providing valuable insights for internal program development and competitor analysis.

#### Sportradar US - Sports Data Operator 
September 2022 - Present
- Attended NCAA/Pro sporting events (mens and women's basketball, baseball, men's and women's volleyball, soccer) and recorded game-related statistics (using company software).
- Communicated with supervisor on-site regarding the specifics of data.
- Successfully operated 230+ games with 5-star performance.

### Featured Data Science Projects (will add visualizations to this section)
#### Autoencoder Anomaly Analysis for NBA Players:
- Delved deeper into understanding the fluctuations in NBA player game-to-game performances, particularly focusing on Kobe Bryant's 2008-2009 season.
- Created an autoencoder model in an effort to uncover any non-linear relationships and nuances indicative of performance trends.

#### Advanced NBA Referee Analysis:
- Explored decision-making patterns of NBA referees to enhance fairness and integrity of the sport. Aimed to identify areas where officiating can be optimized.
- Engineered a 1410x23 data frame that utilized cleaned referee statistics. Created advanced neural network models (three FNNs and one CNN) for comprehensive analysis.
- Obtained 92% test accuracy through innovative CNN application, confirming the effectiveness of the approach in identifying patterns and areas of improvement in referee standards.

#### Predicting CCRB's Outcome on Civilian Complaints

### About Me

At heart, I’ve always been a creative storyteller. I have fond memories of being that kid in the classroom that could not wait for writing hour, a time during which I knew I could explore the greatest depths of my imagination and convey these thoughts on a piece of paper. Often being one of the quietest people in my classes, I truly valued writing as a place where I could simply be _me_ and express _my_ thoughts without my social fears becoming too overwhelming. My love for sports also manifested during this time. I started playing and analyzing the sport of basketball at the age of 8. The art of **precision** and **decision-making** is what ultimately got me interested in the game. I found it so fascinating how much repetitive practice it took to obtain a satisfactory level of accuracy in regards to shooting and making a basket. I also appreciated the managerial side of the sport, such as coaches having to pinpoint specific rotational decisions and playcalls, or owners having to manage a specific salary budget in order to create a balanced and well-put-together roster. As both a player and a fan, I adored this type of analysis, and it's something that has simply been a part of me ever since then. Last but not least, technology was a huge fascination I held as a child. I was that kid that begged his parents for the newest iPod and Nintendo DS that hit the market. Even though I was often met with a denial, I would endlessly research how these devices worked, what their unique features were, and why they were, in the eyes of a kid, simply revolutionary. I viewed these devices as items that would make mine and so many other lives easier and more enjoyable.

Time went on and, before I knew it, it was time to embark on my collegiate journey and turn my passions into a career. However, I had no idea how to blend my interests into one entity. I eventually decided to take the “easy” way out and began my undergraduate years at UC San Diego as an English major. I quickly realized this was not for me, as that field did not encapsulate all of my passions and occupational goals in the long run. I felt like I was at a loss, until I discovered the fields of **Cognitive Science** and **Data Science**. I had finally found my niche. I could explore the cognition behind decision-making and why people think the way that they do. I would learn about the newest technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence, and apply these tools to unique projects tailored towards my passions. And, arguably most important of all, I would continue to showcase my love for creativity and storytelling through my work. Graphical visualizations and analytical journals detailing my projects were only a couple of avenues that would take me back to being that kid who was eagerly waiting for writing hour in order to truly express himself. My undergraduate years are where I truly found myself, evidenced by how happy I was and how much I succeeded.

I always knew that I wanted to carry this success into graduate school, and am now continuing to hone and improve my data science skills as a Data Science Master’s student at UC Irvine. I’ve learned to love being presented with a unique challenge, working from the ground up to solve that challenge in an efficient manner, and piecing together my discoveries with that same **creative** magic and **precise** nature that I’ve held so deeply from a young age. My analytical mindset continues to coincide with my love for all sectors where decision-making, risk management, and pattern recognition is at the forefront of organizational importance. I plan to continue exploring these vast passions of mine throughout my time in this program and the start of my career, in addition to learning more invaluable skills through my coursework in order to sharpen my expertise within the field. As I continue to move towards graduating in December 2024, I find myself reflecting on the journey that has led me to this point. From the child who loved writing and playing basketball, to the tech enthusiast who dreamed of the latest gadgets, each of these experiences has shaped my approach to data science. They have given me a unique perspective, blending creativity with analytical rigor, and a passion for understanding complex systems, whether in sports, technology, or cognition. My journey has been unconventional, but it has equipped me with a diverse set of skills and insights that I believe are invaluable in this field. As I look towards the future, I am excited about the endless possibilities that await. I see myself not just as a data scientist, but as an **innovator** who uses data to tell stories, solve problems, and make impactful decisions.

#### Advanced NBA Referee Analysis:

Growing up, I was captivated by the fast-paced excitement of NBA games, but I often found myself puzzled by controversial calls that seemed to shift the momentum unfairly. This curiosity about the human element in officiating sparked a data-driven quest to unravel the complexities of referee decision-making. Once again channeling my **passions for basketball and data science**, I embarked this project to analyze NBA referee patterns using **advanced neural networks**. I engineered a data frame with **over 30,000** datapoints that captured the precise statistics of 47 experienced referees across all 30 NBA teams, which included the referees’ total games officiated for each team, win/loss percentages, average points, free throw attempts, personal, offensive, and shooting fouls, and statistics for the opponents that each team faced. This dataset became the foundation for my deep learning exploration, where I implemented **three feed-forward neural networks (FNNs)** and, most innovatively, a **1D convolutional neural network (CNN)**. The CNN's remarkable **92% test accuracy** not only validated my approach but also opened new avenues for enhancing the fairness and integrity of the sport I love. As a whole, I successfully contributed to a future where technology and human judgment work in harmony, ensuring every whistle blown is as fair as the game itself.

#### Predicting CCRB's Outcome on Civilian Complaints

During my final year at UCSD, I collaborated with three classmates on a project addressing police accountability in New York City. We developed a predictive system for civilian complaint outcomes against NYPD officers, utilizing a dataset of 279,645 unique complaints from the NYPD Misconduct Complaint Database. Our work involved extensive **feature engineering**, transforming raw data into meaningful predictors and addressing the significant challenge of imbalanced classes in our target variable `CCRBDisposition`. We implemented and precisely compared four machine learning models: **logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting**. To gain deeper insights into the factors influencing CCRB decisions, we employed the **Eli5 Python library** for feature importance analysis. This process revealed key predictors such as the officer's status, gender, allegation type, and contact outcome. After complete evaluation using **F1-scores**, **precision**, and **recall** metrics, logistic regression emerged as the optimal algorithm, achieving a remarkable **97.3% F1-score**. This project not only enhanced our practical data science skills but also contributed importance insights to the ongoing dialogue about leveraging technology to improve transparency and accountability in law enforcement practices.

**Key Skills:** Machine Learning, Feature Engineering, Imbalanced Data Handling, Model Comparison, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, Feature Importance Analysis (Eli5), Evaluation Metrics (F1-score, Precision, Recall), Teamwork, Collaborative Problem-Solving, Data-Driven Decision Making

#### R Case Study
In another project I completed at UCSD, my group and I explored the critical public health issue of tobacco usage among American youth. Our mission was to investigate the evolving landscape of tobacco and e-cigarette use among middle and high school students from a CDC dataset spanning from 2015-2019. With the power of the **R programming language**, we utilized several tools, including **tidyverse, dplyr, and ggplot2**, to clean, reshape, and visualize the data. Our analysis produced a series of illuminating visualizations that brought multiple trends to life (as seen below). One of our most striking findings was the surge in popularity of sweet-flavored vapes among youth. This discovery raised important questions about the marketing strategies of e-cigarette companies and their impact on young consumers. Additionally, we uncovered a **zero-sum relationship** between e-cigarette adoption and traditional tobacco use, suggesting that as vaping increased, conventional smoking declined proportionally. Our project also revealed gender disparities in tobacco use and highlighted the rise of specific brands like JUUL in the e-cigarette market. We also ensured the applicability of our findings by sampling data across different Primary Sampling Units (PSUs). Overall, this project deepened my understanding of how data science can inform public health policies, in addition to being a powerful demonstration of how R and statistical analysis can uncover substantial patterns in datasets with real-world implications, potentially influencing strategies to address youth tobacco use. The experience reinforced my passion for using data science to solve real-world problems and contribute to important societal discussions.

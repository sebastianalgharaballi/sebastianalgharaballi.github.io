As a Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist, I blend creativity with analytical rigor to solve complex data-driven problems. My journey from a young storyteller and basketball enthusiast to a tech-savvy innovator has shaped my unique approach to data science. I'm passionate about creating and fine-tuning ML and AI models, leveraging data for decision-making, and applying these tools to projects that align with my diverse interests. Currently honing my skills as a Data Science Master's student at UC Irvine and as a Machine Learning Engineer at MoodMe, I thrive on challenges that allow me to efficiently solve problems from the ground up, always infusing my work with the same creativity and precision that has driven me since childhood.

- Analyzed OpenAI datasets and leveraged clustering techniques to identify user patterns, informing GPT-model adjustments and improved response relevancy.

#### MoodMe - Machine Learning Engineer & Co-Founder 
December 2023 - Present
- Leader in the creation and implementation of machine learning models for innovative and unbiased emotion detection applications.
- Collaborated closely with engineering and marketing teams to integrate AI-powered technologies with our services, focusing on user engagement and unique insights.
- Successfully benchmarked and enhanced our emotion detection model through transfer learning, boosting, and noise injection, achieving a 22% increase in overall accuracy.
- Led the development of a customized BERT text emotion detection model that is the backbone of EmotionTrak, a well-being diary that helps users track and understand their emotional patterns over time. Model achieved an F1 score of 0.89 in detecting emotions across 8 categories after analyzing over 500,000 text samples during testing.

#### Donald Bren School of ICS - Master of Data Science Ambassador 
October 2023 - Present
- Student representative for the MDS Program.
- Supported the creation and development of ideas for marketing campaigns.
- Conducted time series analysis using R's "forecast" library and Python's "statsmodels" to track and predict trends in data science master's programs across the U.S., providing valuable insights for internal program development and competitor analysis.

#### Sportradar US - Sports Data Operator 
September 2022 - Present
- Attended NCAA/Pro sporting events (mens and women's basketball, baseball, men's and women's volleyball, soccer) and recorded game-related statistics (using company software).
- Communicated with supervisor on-site regarding the specifics of data.
- Successfully operated 230+ games with 5-star performance.

### Featured Data Science Projects (will add visualizations to this section)
#### Autoencoder Anomaly Analysis for NBA Players:
- Delved deeper into understanding the fluctuations in NBA player game-to-game performances, particularly focusing on Kobe Bryant's 2008-2009 season.
- Created an autoencoder model in an effort to uncover any non-linear relationships and nuances indicative of performance trends.
- Achieved 100% evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) when labeling Bryant's games as above or below average, potentially discovering factors that contributed to a range of performances. 

#### Advanced NBA Referee Analysis:
- Explored decision-making patterns of NBA referees to enhance fairness and integrity of the sport. Aimed to identify areas where officiating can be optimized.
- Engineered a 1410x23 data frame that utilized cleaned referee statistics. Created advanced neural network models (three FNNs and one CNN) for comprehensive analysis.
- Obtained 92% test accuracy through innovative CNN application, confirming the effectiveness of the approach in identifying patterns and areas of improvement in referee standards.

#### Predicting CCRB's Outcome on Civilian Complaints
- Addressed predicting officer remediation amid the complexity of police misconduct complaints.
- Extracted pivotal data features using the "Eli5" Python library, directing focus on variables affecting disciplinary outcomes. Developed and evaluated logistic regression, K-NN, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting models (using F1-score).
- Unveiled logistic regression as the optimum predictive algorithm, enabling accurate forecasts of officer remediation outcomes.

#### R Case Study
- Investigated the prevailing trends in tobacco usage among American youth.
- Wrangled/analyzed a comprehensive CDC dataset and produced multiple visualization models to illuminate detailed patterns in youth tobacco and e-cigarette usage.
- Unveiled pivotal insights, such as the popularity of sweet-flavored vapes and a zero-sum relationship between e-cigarettes and traditional tobacco usage.
